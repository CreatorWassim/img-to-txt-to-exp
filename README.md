# Image-to-Text-to-Explanation Project

Welcome to the Image-to-Text-to-Explanation project repository! This project focuses on converting images into text and providing detailed explanations.

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a system that converts any given image with text to textual representation and explanations based on the identified content.

## Features

- **Image Processing:** Converts the original input image to BGR image, and grayscaled image.

- **Image-to-Text Conversion:** uses a sophisticated image processing method called *EasyOCR*, that is based on deep learning to convert the image intoÂ written text.

- **Text Processing:** relies on a word-by-word correction method. Uses the '370k English words corpus' dataset to compare the extracted text with the words in the dataset and make adjustments as needed.
  
- **Text-to-Explanation Generation:** Employs one of the most powerful text generation API, OpenAI GPT's API, to generate detailed explanations based on the extracted text.

## Software

- The code in the repository was tested with Python 3.11.4.

- The packages I used to run the code in the book are listed in [packages.txt](packages.txt) . To install the requirements using The standard package manager for Python *PIP*, run the following at the Terminal command (if you are running JUPYTER notebook on VSCode)
